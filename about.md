Makes player's glow blending, which was changed to be solid in 2.2.

Doesn't work on the robot and spider due to technical limitations, but they weren't blending in 2.1 either.

## Options

- <cg>Enable Blending Glow:</c> quickly enable/disable this mod without needing to restart
- <cy>Increase Brightness:</c> increases glow brightness by 1.5x to emulate the glow color pre-2.2
